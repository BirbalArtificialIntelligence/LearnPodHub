## ML Pipeline Workflow

The machine learning pipeline follows these steps:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Sources: User-generated content, external datasets
   - Storage: AWS S3, structured in versioned buckets
   - Format: JSON, CSV, Text files

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning: Removing noise, handling missing values
   - Tokenization: Text tokenization for NLP tasks
   - Feature extraction: Converting raw data to features
   - See [examples/ml-pipeline/preprocessing.py](../examples/ml-pipeline/preprocessing.py)

3. **Data Annotation**
   - Tool: Label Studio
   - Process: Human-in-the-loop annotation
   - Quality control: Inter-annotator agreement metrics
   - Export: Labeled datasets for training

4. **Model Training**
   - Framework: Hugging Face Transformers, scikit-learn
   - Tracking: MLflow experiment logging
   - Hyperparameter optimization: Grid search, Bayesian optimization
   - Evaluation: Cross-validation, precision/recall metrics
   - See [examples/ml-pipeline/model_training.py](../examples/ml-pipeline/model_training.py)

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, F1 score, BLEU score (for translation)
   - Ethical evaluation: Bias detection, fairness assessment
   - Error analysis: Understanding model limitations

6. **Model Deployment**
   - Serving: TensorFlow Serving
   - Versioning: MLflow Model Registry
   - Containerization: Docker images
   - Scaling: Kubernetes deployments

7. **Monitoring & Feedback**
   - Performance monitoring: Accuracy drift detection
   - User feedback collection
   - Retraining triggers: Scheduled or performance-based

## Multilingual Support

- Models trained on multilingual datasets
- Language-specific fine-tuning
- Cross-lingual transfer learning
- Support for low-resource languages

## Ethical AI Practices

- Bias detection in training data
- Fairness metrics across demographic groups
- Explainability tools for model decisions
- Regular ethical audits of deployed models

## Model Types

1. **Content Classification**
   - Purpose: Categorize content by topic, intent, or policy compliance
   - Architecture: Fine-tuned transformer models
   - Languages: 40+ languages supported

2. **Named Entity Recognition**
   - Purpose: Identify entities in text (people, organizations, locations)
   - Architecture: Custom spaCy models
   - Integration: API endpoints for real-time extraction

3. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Purpose: Detect sentiment in user-generated content
   - Models: Language-specific fine-tuned models
   - Output: Sentiment scores with confidence levels

4. **Content Moderation**
   - Purpose: Identify policy-violating content
   - Approach: Multi-stage classification with human review
   - Performance: High precision with human verification
